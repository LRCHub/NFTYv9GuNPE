Oh, to be alive
It's a struggle to survive
From the dark of night
Will I reach and feel the light
Will I choose my fate
In the twinkle of an eye
From the firmament
Your ideal will come to life
Rumors grow from nothing
Like a whisper in the crowd
Stars they will collide
Lovers will abide
Be careful what you wish for
We could be the very best
Put me to the test
Think about it baby
Such a lonely voice
Gotta cry for Judgement Day
A dream realized
Got to pray to make it heard
Rumors grow from nothing
Like a whisper in the crowd
Stars they will collide
Lovers will abide
Be careful what you wish for
We could be the very best
Put me to the test
Think about it, baby
Towers come crumbling down
Strike of lightning
Build it back up again
Circle of life slowly turns
Rumors grow...
