Your walking the tight rope
With no one to hold you when you fall
Hold on to what you got
Or you'll end up losing it all

Be careful what you wish for, my friend
You might find what you fear
Listen to the whispers in your ear

Your wicked ways
Your wicked ways
You keep on pushing
But now you are pushing too far
The demon will find you
No matter just who you are

Be careful what you wish for, my friend
You might find what you fear
Listen to the whispers in your ear

Be careful what you wish for, my friend
You might find what you fear
Listen to the whispers in your ear
Your wicked ways
Your wicked ways
Your wicked ways
Oh!

With friends just like this
I sure don't need enemies
A cheat never wins and winners
They don't ever cheat

Be careful what you wish for, my friend
You might find what you fear
Listen to the whispers in your ear
Be careful what you wish for, my friend
You might find what you fear
Listen to the whispers in your ear
Your wicked ways
Oh!

Your wicked ways
Wicked ways
