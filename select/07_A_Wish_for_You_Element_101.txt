Catch a ride to our hang-out
Don't stay outside, it's much nice in here
I heard the news, you were home
And I just gotta see you once more

But the silence is shocking
I'm knocking, locking up
Your heart was so near
And what surprises you much
I almost didn't know you

Springtime left you all on your own but still all alone
You are marvelous, you're the one I always did adore
This time left you all on your own but still all alone
You are marvelous, you are the one I do adore

Determine who you wanna be
And promise yourself that you'll be true

Springtime left you all on your own but still all alone
You are marvelous, you're the one I always did adore
This time left you all on your own but still all alone
You are marvelous, you are the one I do adore

Determine who you wanna be
And promise yourself that you'll be true
Determine who you wanna be
And promise yourself that you'll be true

And sitting quiet we're talking
I'm walking circles all around my head
And turning pages of notes
I knew you still had it in you

You're the person we're missing, still wishing
That you saw what we see in you
I wish you knew it was true
You're perfect in all you do
