I sent a wish to a star, my heart felt pretty hard
I wished for you to wish for me for Christmas

I've been a good girl all year
It's only you I want I fear
So darling, wish for me to wish for you for Christmas

But in the cold
The lonely nights hit twice as hard
I hope you know
You don't have to stay alone for too long

You can be my baby
If you don't think I'm crazy
I'll let the winter wonder wisp us away
