Time goes by so fast, and days they seem to dance
Into the distance till they're gone
If I had a map, to lead you down life's path
I'm give it to you but I don't
So go on

Cry hard, laugh loud
Be humble, stand proud
And don't be afraid of your fears
Let love break your heart
Just be who you are
All of this
All that there is
I wish for you

You can never know which way your world will turn
How the stars are gonna fall
Salty tears they burn
There are lessons you will learn
But you'll be stronger for it all
Oh, yes you will

Cry hard, laugh loud
Be humble, stand proud
Hold onto your faith with all your heart
Be careful, be brave
Be still but don't stay
In any one place for too long
Remember God's grace
Give more than you take
All of this
All that there is
I wish for you
